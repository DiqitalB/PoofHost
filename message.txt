To the person who caused so many coincidences, that it's hard to keep count. To the person with whom I've made unforgettable memories, with much more to come. Even if I'm not there with you right now, just know you ocupy my mind every second you spend reading this message. Never did I think I could love a person as much as I love you. Never did I think I would want to spend every single day of my life with just one person, you. Every day I wake up, reading the messages you sent me last night, and think of days where I wouldn't read messages but wake up next to you. Some days, I fantasize about you making pancakes, us hugging, sleeping together, going home TOGETHER, living the dream. Celebrating the New Year together, wrapping presents for friends & family, doing everything we've missed out on as kids. Sometimes I get scared of loosing you, but I make myself forget, and enjoy every moment we have as if it was our last. All the time I've spent with you taught me that no matter the conditions you're in, if it's meant to be, it will be. Maybe not when we want it the most, but when we need it the most. Good people still exist, you just have to be patient, and when you find them, keep them close. Can't wait to see you, hug you, kiss you, after all of this is over. Love you, your Boo.
